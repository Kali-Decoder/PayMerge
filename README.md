## Why Pruxel

Developers do the invisible work that keeps projects alive — reviews, tests, triage, docs — and it rarely shows up in payroll.  
Spreadsheets and politics reward the loudest, not the most impactful.

Pruxel makes the invisible visible. We pull contribution events from GitHub, apply a transparent scoring rubric, and produce share-based payouts you can audit, explain, and stream on-chain.

## Highlights

- 🧠 Quality-weighted scoring (PRs, reviews, issues, tests) — clearly documented.
- 🔍 Explainability: every payout shows the events → points → share → amount chain.
- 🪪 Zero-login friction: GitHub OAuth / GitHub App install in minutes.
- 💳 Payouts: simulate or send (USDC/USDT/DAI) with Superfluid/Sablier (plug-and-play).
- 📈 Premium UI: glassmorphic dashboard, line + radar visuals, CSV export.
- 🔒 **Privacy by default**: no code contents; only event metadata.
